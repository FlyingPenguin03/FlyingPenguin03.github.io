        <h1>Joshua Salmon</h1>
        <h2>Senior High Schooler in Yalaha, Florida</h2>
        
         <p> I am a homeschooled senior in high school. I am currently taking one high school course 
		     and three dual credit college courses.
         </p>
         <p>
            I enjoy video gaming, and I am one of the leaders of a successful Christian gaming community.
			<a href="https://4kgaming.org/">For the King Gaming</a>, renamed in 2019 is a community
			with around 130 members. Previously it was known as Fear the Lord Gaming, with roots
			back to 2004. I have been with For the King since 2017 and have dedicated a lot of time
			to it's growth and administration. 
         </p> 
         <p>
             I also enjoy many forms of outdoor activites including but not limited to hiking, running, camping,
			 and swimming. Most of all, I enjoy going to Africa and spending hours in the bush relaxing by the river
			 or searching for wildlife on the massive reserve. Our family owns a commercial lodge on the 
			 <a href="https://limpopo-lipadi.org/">Limpopo-Lipadi Game Reserve<a/>, which we visit frequently.
         </p>
		 <p> Lastly, I am engaged in ministry at my local church, <a href="https://www.bbcleesburg.com/">Berean Baptist Church</a>. 
		     I lead songs in the evening service as well as sing for specials and play offertories on the piano. 
			 I am often called upon for tech support by the pastor or church members for various needs. I recently completed
			 a slideshow presentation of our Israel trip in April 2019 that we showed in church. I am also currently designing
			 a new website for the church using Wordpress.
